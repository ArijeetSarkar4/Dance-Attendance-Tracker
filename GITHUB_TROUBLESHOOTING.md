# GitHub Deployment Troubleshooting Guide for KUSA Dance Attendance App

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: "Repository not found" or Access Denied
**Solution:**
1. Make sure your repository is set to **Public** (not Private)
2. Go to repository Settings → General → scroll to bottom
3. In "Danger Zone", ensure visibility is "Public"

### Issue 2: Files not uploading properly
**Solution:**
1. Create repository first with just a README
2. Then click "Add file" → "Upload files"
3. Make sure you upload these exact files:
   - `index.html`
   - `styles.css` 
   - `script.js`
   - `kusa-logo.svg`
   - `kathak-login.png` (your background image)
   - `klathak-ghungroo.png` (your background image)

### Issue 3: GitHub Pages not working
**Solution:**
1. Repository Settings → Pages
2. Source: "Deploy from a branch"
3. Branch: `main` (not master)
4. Folder: `/ (root)`
5. Click Save and wait 5-10 minutes

### Issue 4: Images not loading
**Solution:**
- Make sure image files are uploaded to the same directory as HTML
- File names must match exactly (case-sensitive)
- If you don't have the actual images, use placeholder images

   7. Click "Create repository"
   ```

2. **Upload Files**
   ```
   1. Click "uploading an existing file" link
   2. Drag and drop ALL files from your folder
   3. Commit message: "Add KUSA Dance attendance app"
   4. Click "Commit changes"
   ```

3. **Enable GitHub Pages**
   ```
   1. Click "Settings" tab (top of repository)
   2. Scroll to "Pages" in left sidebar
   3. Source → "Deploy from a branch"
   4. Branch → "main"

   (Replace YOUR-USERNAME with your actual GitHub username)
   ```

### Method 2: Using Git Commands (Advanced)

If you prefer command line:

```bash
# Navigate to your project folder
cd "C:\Users\ASARKAR\OneDrive - Cox Automotive\Desktop\Dance Attendance- app"

# Initialize git repository
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit files
git commit -m "Initial commit - KUSA Dance Attendance App"

# Add remote repository (replace with your actual repo URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/kusa-dance-attendance.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Quick Alternative: Netlify Drop

If GitHub is giving you trouble, try Netlify (even easier):

1. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
2. Scroll to "Want to deploy a new site without connecting to Git?"
3. Drag your entire project folder to the deployment area
4. Get instant live URL (no account required)
